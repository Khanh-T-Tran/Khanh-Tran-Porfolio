                    <p> 
                        I am a full stack developer who has a back ground of computer technician, medical technician, and entrepreneur. When computer knowledge comfortably fills me in the wild coding world , planning, focusing, and team work are the three useful skills that I have developed during the time I work as an entrepreneur, which will be match a full description of a full stack developer. In addition, quality is also a very important character that I have drawn from the time working in medical field. I am a challenge seeker, a consistent trouble shooter, and a quality full stack developer.
